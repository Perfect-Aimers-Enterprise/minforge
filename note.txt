README Note

//Dont' write anything yet until i send you the model codes

* user can import the auto encoder
* the latent or transform is taking the input X just after it's been scaled because '.... write the reason'
* the reconstruct is taking the latent space because '.... wirte the reason'
* the analomy scores takes the input X just after it's been scaled because '......write the reason'

FOr utils
* cluster kmeans and reduce pca with reduce tsne take the latent value right? can it also take other values, if yes, list it and explain sceneiro.
and what does the number of components means or do, let them know what the defaults are and what they should consider when using it. note that, use the nmae of my utils instead of the exact brnads name, although you can explain the exact brand name like kmeans etc... underhood where needed.

alos, for our reduce_tsne, explain the datas and list the datas needed, why the default and what they should consider when using theres, in all these, write an example of how to use it and then refer them to our docs website or github repo

talk about the rest. but note that it should be in the mannere, model first, utils next and visualization lastly

*also for plot clustler, they should know it takes both pca and tsne, so they should do well to state the method they are to use, also how do i get to save my model first so that users have the option to import the saved model?

explain this to me and not on the readmen "plt.scatter(X_2d[:,0], X_2d[:,1], c=clusters, cmap=cmap, s=50)"
